**NOTE**: Please DO NOT edit any of the files that I wrote. To prevent conflicts, you should write your code/answers in new files.

After forking this repo, you should set my repo as a remote repo of yours:
```
git add remote upstream https://github.com/vuoanh/python_assessment.git
```

So that you can update later tasks to your repo by pulling from my repo :
```
git pull upstream master
```

### Task 1:

Inside the directory named task1, write a python script that reads in the file sorted_models.txt, and plot a scatter plot between total score (x-axis) and interface_delta_X (y-axis). Make the plot as pretty and consistent as you can.
