**NOTE**: Please DO NOT edit any of the files that I wrote. To prevent conflicts, you should write your code/answers in new files.

### Task 1:

Inside the directory named task1, write a python script that reads in the file sorted_models.txt, and plot a scatter plot between total score (x-axis) and interface_delta_X (y-axis). Make the plot as pretty and consistent as you can.
