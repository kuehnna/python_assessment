These are my two solutions for assignment 1. Both of them are to be used in the following way:

'''
python [name of script file] [name/location of sorted_models.txt]
'''

Please also try for both scripts what happens when you try to give them more than one file. :)

The script scat_regular produces a normal scatter plot (that I made a bit prettier than by default). scat_density produces a density map for the most densely populated bit of the plot because I thought that part was very crowded. Unfortunately the code I copied and modified is a bit too expert for me to fully understand what it does.
